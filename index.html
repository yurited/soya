                        <p>
                        There are plenty of habits form mobile applications outside there, however I found lots of them lack of  the balance between simplicity and versatility and can’t provide a good solution to help people form habits. With a lot of case studies, market research and user interviews. I want to create a lightweight product that providing better solutions to help people form healthy habits in an easy and fun way.</p>
                        <h3>Solutions & Process</h3> 
                        <p>Therefore, based on <a href="">early stage research & iteration report</a> 
                        I made some milestone key features for my app so far:
                        The app will offer users plenty of pre-set small and attainable healthy challenges 
                        to make sure people can make the first step easily and find inspirations in the long run</p>

                        In the meantime, I will do the 2nd user testing for my simply Invision prototype to see how user engage with the app and whether they are easy to use and keep doing interations based on testing results </p>

                        <p id="interndescription">
                        Last summer, I worked at Eventbrite as a product design intern working on the events discovery and search team. One of the important project is to find a solution offer a compelling browse experience for consumers who are interested in finding events.</p>
                        <h3>Problems:</h3> 
                        <p>Eventbrite has been using the directory pages as a stop-­gap solution to surface events within a given category by using search results pages with an empty query and category filters. However, this approach has several major flaws:</p>
                        <p>
                        Browse mindset is different from the search mindset. Users earlier in the event discovery 
                        funnel are looking for more guidance and inspiration. Hence, just presented with search results, they are less likely to engage with the content and are more likely to bounce off the site. 
                        </p> 
                        <h3>Design Solution:</h3>
                        <p>After long research and several iterations we decided <strong> add a gallery view to improve the browse experience and add large organizers profile cards on search result page</strong> to improve 
                        search experience.</p>  <p>
                        Adding a  browse functionality will empower user to discover, explore new live experiences, and encourages exploration through engaging content.
                        The new gallery view experience leverages event cards, reduces white space at the top. Users have the option to toggle between gallery view and list view depending on their needs.

The next step will be refine user experience to increase engagement. Implement more aligned list view. </p>

                        Indiegogo campaign project — A high quality and well designed bag which working with a app.
                        The project went through 5 mouth before we put it on the Indiegogo, I worked and collaborated  with a lot of people in the team to create this bag from drafting sketches, to sewing prototypes, to engineering the HiSmart controller and dedicated ourselves to provide valuable features to make the life of the urban explorer more efficient and enjoyable.

                       <p>
                       I  came up this idea when I simply found there are dozens of app on the App Store help people recording how they spend their money but few apps to help people figure out how we spend all our time. It’s worth to design a beautiful and lightweight product to help people figure out how they spend their time and make some important decisions in their life. 
                       After all, “ Time is Galleon—Harry Pottery ” :P</p>

                       <h3>Think process & Product Definition</h3>
                       <p>After a few user interview, Market research and with myself as a user person, I narrow the target audience group and make define this product as a  simple time recording tool to help tracking users time usage in the very easy way with friendly user experience.</p>
                       <p>Tindex's primary demographic is working students or people who have just entered the workforce. They need a product like Tindex to help them to stop setting unattainable goals and to start using their time more wisely.
                       But, It can also be used as a product to quickly test the amount of time it will actually take to complete a specific task.</p>

                        <p>
                        Farmers market has always been very popular in the U.S. But there is no app outside there to help user to track down the information that they need. The aim of this project is <strong>focus on information enhancement which help users to get reliable and accurate information and guides user to the nearest farmers market</strong>. 
                        </p>

                         <h3>Design Process:</h3>                
                         <p>
                         It’s always been hard to define an ending moment  for a side project, and as much as I want to see the final version of the design I also enjoy every step of the design process, and I reminded myself 3 things constantly through the journey, It should be designed to reach the project goal in the best way, easy to use and well crafted.

                        Self-care is the very first long-term mobile app project I built in school. I built this project with one of my friends <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tony-zhang-4513316a" target="_blank"> Tongzhang</a>. We went to the same college for BA and shared same design interest. We thought the existing medical products in the market is all bring us very serious and cold feelings, so we decide to create more bright and colorful product with unique features to help people get more information when they doesn't feel well.

                        This application allows customers to easily obtain a diagnosis by tapping on the position of the body map and symptoms report. Let's users get more information about their illness. It will also give user treatment advise. Such as home remedies, medication recommendations, and scheduling an appointment with a nearby physician.
                        Three main tasks have been showing both the schematic walking through and app screen user navigate through reach his or her goal.
